The following application is a refactoring of code for a random password generator. 
This application will generate the user a randomized password based on the inclusion or exclusion of:
1. Special characters
2. Upper case letters
3. Lower case letters
4. Numbers
Each criteria is presented as a prompt to the user and is recorded via the console log. The console will also log when the user presses the 'Generate password' button
The prompts will ask the user to input a specific response to the questions asked and will then confirm their selection and prompt for a correction if needed. 
Once all prompts are completed, the user will be presented a randomized password based on their selections.

The deployed application can be used here:
